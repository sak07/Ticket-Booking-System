Ticket Booking System
This project is a basic Ticket Booking System built with Any MVC architecture framework (backend) and Next.js (frontend). Users will be able to view available events and book tickets.
The developer can decide the input format, database schema, and structure of the API as long as the system supports:

1.	Listing events
2.	Creating a booking for an event
3.	Ensuring bookings don’t exceed available seats
The backend (Any MVC) will expose the endpoints and handle validation, authentication, and database updates.The frontend (Next.js) will display events and provide a simple form to submit bookings.
The goal is to create a small but functional end-to-end ticket booking flow.
